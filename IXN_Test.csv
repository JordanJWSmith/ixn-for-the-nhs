In such times, it is practically impossible to keep a track of all the activities/ appointments. Many a times, it happens that we may miss an important task; for example: taking medicines, attending a meeting, returning library books, paying the bills etc. And this cycle can keep going on endlessly. The human mind is not designed to multitask, it needs to work things out one at a time. This requires us to maintain our focus on the task at hand, and as a result other important things take a backstage and some may even slip out of our minds. In order to address this problem, we have come up with a Weekly Task Alerting System. This system is designed to alert the user of all the important tasks that are due on a specific day, every week. So now, the user can carry on with his/her life without any worries. The developed project is a tasks reminder app, with AI-powered Chatbot that will make user enjoy productivity. Whether your goal is to make good habits or get rid of bad ones. This application helps you to make sure that the tasks you set actually get done, with the help of its AI assistant. It monitors your android phone, pings you at times you’re likely to see a notification and makes sure you don’t forget about items on your to-do list. With this, which is one of the bot characters, this app brings you not only your tasks reminder but also a free productivity assistant that engages you throughout the day to create a more productive version of yourself.",https://github.com/fanghao6666/neural-networks-and-deep-learning,https://youtu.be/_REMuSc0R-8,www.ixnprojects.com/QYDKnnCcKXc,deanthomas@hogwarts.ac.uk,Hogwarts

The “RFID based Public Transport Ticketing System” can be used easily anytime, anywhere and ticket will be available in the customer’s phone in the form of “RFID”. GPS module is used for providing validation of the ticket at the source and deletion at the destination.The process of standing in lines to book the tickets and after that carrying the tickets is curdled and hectic process, hencethis project is proposed as a solution to this problem. The main objective of this project is developing an android application so that passengers can easily book the tickets online directly from their smart phones and a message is send to their own phones, which is enough for travelling a desired distance. For security reasons the information about every user is stored in CLOUD which needs to to be accessed during each time while bookingticket for validation purpose. This change of paradigm benefits from the fact that cloud ticketing system can be accessed through the Internet, since they can be elastically grown or shrunk, providing easier scalability and high availability. The system provides two payment methods. Firstly, a customer can pay using their wallet and secondly user can request ticket checker to transfer some amount in the wallet. The information for each user is stored in a SQL database for security purpose. Also, the ticket checkersare provided with an application to search for the user’s ticket with the ticket number in the cloud database for checking purposes.

The teacher part has come up with handling all the sports related activity assigned by the admin. Teacher performs various task such as taking the attendance of the students who are registered for a particular sport event, viewing the list of students to mark the winner of each round, generating the results based on multiple rounds won by the student and also can view the 1st, 2nd and 3rd standings of student’s name for the particular sport event.
