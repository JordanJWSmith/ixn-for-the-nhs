# IXN for the NHS

This repository contains source code for the IXN For The NHS web app. It is a portal for the NHS to easily display student project information. Administrators upload a CSV file containing project information on the site's admin page, which the system uses to auto-generate static web pages for each project. Each page contains an embedded YouTube link, an abstract and various other pieces of project information. These projects are then displayed in project galleries throughout the site, ranked by popularity. Admins can also assign projects to various Working Groups to be displayed in group-specific galleries. 

Additional features include a postcode lookup to find your nearest IXN Administrator, uploading and displaying events, and links to submit project requests and sign up to the newsletter. 

There are currently two instances hosted on the web: 
* [Demo Site (with fake data)](http://ixnportal.com/ixnforthenhsdemo)
* [Live Site (with real data)](http://ixnportal.com/ixnforthenhs)

A similar IXN Portal site was developed for IBM. This achieves the same functionality as above, but without a database. Its repository is [here](https://github.com/JordanJWSmith/ibm_ixn).

This project was developed in a team of three for UCL during the MSc Computer Science course.
